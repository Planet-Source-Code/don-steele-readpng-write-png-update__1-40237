## ReadPNG/Write PNG \*update\*


</div>

### Description

PNG is a free file format (not covered by any patents, and freely available) that offers true color loseless compression. The PNG group provides a Windows DLL for dealing with the files, but unfortunately, the DLL they provide isn't useable from Visual Basic. I've modified the DLL to allow VB to call it and use it, and written a small wrapper module in VB that allows you to Load and Save PNG files to and from picture boxes with a simple function call.

The library itself, and a small sample VB project are included in the archive

i did not write this code i mearly found it for refrence to the original author plase see the included README.1st.txt file
